# TinyURL
    It's a Full Stack App to generate TinyUrl

#   Frontend:
* React:
  1. Library/Framework: Used for building the user interface.
  2. Axios: For making HTTP requests to the backend APIs.
  3. React Router: For managing routing within the application.
  4. Material-UI or Bootstrap: For UI components and styling.
#   Backend:
* Spring Boot:

1.    Spring Web: For building RESTful APIs.
2.    Spring Data JPA: For ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) and interacting with MySQL.
3.    Spring Cache: For caching frequently accessed data using Redis.
4.    Spring Kafka: For integrating Apache Kafka, used for event-driven architecture. 

   *   Java: The primary programming language for building the backend. 
   * Apache Kafka:
   * Messaging System: Used for asynchronous communication between services, particularly for logging, analytics, and cache invalidation.

# Database:
   * MySQL: Relational Database: For storing URL mappings, user data, and other structured data.
# Caching:
   *   Redis: In-Memory Data Store: Used for caching frequently accessed URL mappings to improve performance and reduce a database load.

# Deployment: AWS (Amazon Web Services):

1. EC2: For hosting the Spring Boot application.
2. RDS (Relational Database Service): For managing the MySQL database.
3. ElastiCache: For managing Redis instances for caching.
4. S3: For storing static assets such as the React frontend.
5. Elastic Load Balancer (ELB): For distributing incoming traffic across multiple EC2 instances.
6. MSK (Managed Streaming for Apache Kafka): For managing Kafka infrastructure.

*   Docker: Containerization: To package the application and its dependencies into containers for consistent deployment.
  *   CI/CD Tools: Jenkins or GitHub Actions: For automating builds, tests, and deployments. 
  * Terraform or AWS CloudFormation: For Infrastructure as Code (IaC), managing the deployment of AWS resources.
# Security: 
  *   HTTPS (SSL/TLS):
  * To ensure secure communication between clients and servers.
  
  * OAuth or JWT: Authentication/Authorization: If you plan to secure the API endpoints, OAuth or JWT can be used.

# Monitoring & Logging:
1. AWS CloudWatch:
    For monitoring application performance, logs, and setting up alerts.
    Log4j or SLF4J: Logging: For application-level logging within the Spring Boot app.

# Analytics:
Custom Analytics Service:
Data Aggregation & Visualization: Optional service for tracking how many times URLs are accessed, which can be stored in a time-series database like AWS Timestream or visualized using AWS QuickSight or Grafana.
Version Control:
# Git:
Version Control System: For managing the source code.
GitHub or GitLab: For hosting the code repository.
This tech stack will provide a comprehensive and scalable solution for building, deploying, and managing the URL Shortener App. Each component has been chosen to ensure the application is robust, scalable, and maintainable.
